A well-concocted sports drink contains  sugar, water, and sodium in the correct proportions so that  hydration is optimized. The sugar is helpful in maintaining blood- glucose levels needed to fuel muscles, the water keeps an athlete  hydrated, and the sodium enhances fluid absorption and replaces  some of that lost in sweat. The American College of Sports Medicine  states that the goal of drinking fluids during exercise is to prevent  dehydration, which compromises performance and endurance.  The primary source of water loss during intense physical activity  is sweat. Perspiration rates are variable and dependent on many  factors including body composition, humidity, temperature, and  type of exercise. The hydration goal for obtaining optimal  endurance and performance is to replace what is lost, not to over- hydrate. A person’s sweating rate can be approximated by  measuring weight before and after exercise—the difference in  weight will be the amount of water weight you lost.  The primary electrolyte lost in sweat is sodium. One liter of sweat  can contain between 1,000–2,000 milligrams of sodium. Potassium,  magnesium, and calcium are also lost, but in much lower amounts. If  you are exercising at high intensity for greater than ninety minutes,  it is important to replace sodium as well as water. This can be partly  accomplished by consuming a sports drink. The highest content of  sodium in commercial sports drinks is approximately 450 milligrams  per liter and thus will not replace all lost sodium unless a person  drinks several liters. This is NOT recommended, as water  intoxication not only compromises performance, but may also be  deadly. The sodium in sports drinks enhances fluid absorption so  that rehydration is more efficiently accomplished. If you are not  exercising for more than ninety minutes at a high intensity, dietary  intake of sodium and other electrolytes should be sufficient for  replacing lost electrolytes.

              "  'text': 'Simply put, different protein sources differ in their additional  components, so it is necessary to pay attention to the whole  nutrient “package.” Protein-rich animal-based foods commonly  have high amounts of B vitamins, vitamin E, iron, magnesium, and  zinc. Seafood often contains healthy fats, and plant sources of  protein contain a high amount of fiber. Some animal-based protein- rich foods have an unhealthy amount of saturated fat and  cholesterol. When choosing your dietary sources of protein, take  note of the other nutrients and also the non-nutrients, such as  cholesterol, dyes, and preservatives, in order to make good  selections that will benefit your health. For instance, a hamburger  patty made from 80 percent lean meat contains 22 grams of protein,  5.7 grams of saturated fat, and 77 milligrams of cholesterol. A burger  made from 95 percent lean meat also contains 22 grams of protein,  but has 2.3 grams of saturated fat and 60 milligrams of cholesterol.  A cup of boiled soybeans contains 29 grams of protein, 2.2 grams of  saturated fat, and no cholesterol. For more comparisons of protein- rich foods, see Table 6.3 “Sources of Dietary Protein”. To find out  the complete nutrient package of different foods, visit the US  Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Composition Databases.  Table 6.3 Sources of Dietary Protein  Health.

Developmental milestones include  sitting up without support, learning to walk, teething, and vocalizing  among many, many others. All of these changes require adequate  nutrition to ensure development at the appropriate rate.8  Healthy infants grow steadily, but not always at an even pace. For  example, during the first year of life, height increases by 50 percent,  while weight triples. Physicians and other health professionals use  growth charts to track a baby’s development process. Because  infants cannot stand, length is used instead of height to determine  the rate of a child’s growth. Other important developmental  measurements include head circumference and weight. All of these  must be tracked and compared against standard measurements for  an infant’s age.  In the US, for infants and toddlers from birth to 24 months of  age, the WHO growth charts are used to monitor growth. These  standards represent optimal growth for children at this age and  allow for tracking growth trends over time through percentile  rankings. Growth charts may provide warnings that a child has a  medical problem or is malnourished. Growth that is too rapid can  increase the risk for overweight and obesity in childhood and later  in life. Insufficient weight or height gain during infancy may indicate  a condition known as failure-to-thrive (FTT), which is characterized  by poor growth. FTT can happen at any age, but in infancy, it  typically occurs after six months. Some causes include poverty, lack  of enough food, feeding inappropriate foods, and excessive intake of  fruit juice.
